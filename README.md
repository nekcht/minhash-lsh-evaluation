# minhash-lsh-evaluation
<p align="justify">This educational project assesses MinHash Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for text document similarity. It compares LSH with a k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) model using BART embeddings as ground truth. The project involves data preprocessing, shingle creation, and LSH experiments with varying parameters. Findings help understand LSH's efficiency and guide its use in document similarity tasks, enhancing knowledge of LSH techniques and applications.</p
